        <p>I never expected myself to go into album work, since I didn&apos;t really have any influence from other artists. This was the oddball that I&apos;ve taken once I had made friends with a couple of folks who wanted to pursue making music and requested me of designing their future album or singles.</p>

        <p>With this first piece, my first friend gave me the creative freedom of coming up with whatever I felt would have worked with his song. The title of the song was “moncler” so of course the very first thing I did was research the company and their designs. I took into consideration of what was said into lyrics and styled it off that and the references I used in my research.</p>

        <p>With my second piece, while I still had most of control on creating the design, there were some limitations on what my client wanted. I drew up multiple drafts first on paper, while asking them what type of person they were and what they were looking for in this design. With some of my designs I was showing, my client became hooked onto the “melting” design and we went with that as the baseline of the design. Afterwords, I finished up the sketch, remade it in digital with a few extra tweaks and then asked what they would like to do with the background. We then settled on a psychedelic theme and I went from there. Most of the design including the font and extra subtle piece were added which the client was very impressed with.</p>
