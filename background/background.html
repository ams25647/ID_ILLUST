                <p>Backgrounds are a very important piece to drawing manga. They immerse the reader even further with the amount of detail the artist puts in. When I originally started reading comics, I never paid much attention to it as much as I do today; In fact, even when I read new chapters of my favorite series, I make sure to take the time and really appreciate the hard work that the artist has taken into drawing backgrounds for the most crucial parts of the chapter. Each detail was carefully taken into consideration with the final product.</p>

                <p>In this piece, I took the time to go out with my camera to locations which I thought would help me build up the confidence I was looking for when creating backgrounds on my own. At first I used multiple different images of the same area that I was trying to get, where I then used those reference photos and traced over them until I got close to near perfect to what the original photos looked like. Thanks to the DSLR camera I own, I was able to take a high resolution photo where I would be able to zoom in on specific subjects of the image and redraw them with more precise content.</p>

                <p style="color: rgb(100,100,100);">Afterwards I practiced on using screen tones for building the effect of showing different shades and color of the surrounding areas. I used darker shades of screen tone for the areas closer to the ground and lighter shades of screen tones closer to the sky. Other areas of practice included using multiple shades of screen tone in the same area to create an effect that made the subject look more dynamic.</p>
