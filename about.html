        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                I have been drawing since I can remember, but I started getting more into the hobby of drawing
                around the 7th grade when I was hanging around different artists that were also into the same
                things I was in.
            </li>
            <li>
                At around the end of my high school years I really wanted to see if I could take
                my work to the next level and started practicing everyday working on different parts of areas,
                researching many different things and reading books from my favorite artists and seeing what
                they did that made them as good as they are today.
            </li>
            <li>
                Although I still have much to learn and
                much to practice on, I will be using this website as a journal or blog to showcase my
                experience with drawing multiple different areas in art, ranging from creating album artwork to
                working on my own short story comic.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each piece goes more into detail about the thought process of diving into each project,
                from the background research I did before to going into
                drawing up rough drafts of my work.
            </li>
